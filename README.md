##Scripts to install [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), dependencies, and [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) on the [TAILS live OS](https://tails.boum.org).

###Options for TAILS:

1. Run `tailsjoin.sh` on a minimal system with enough disk space to store an indexed blockchain.

2. Run `tailsjoin-fullnode.sh` on either a system with enough disk space to hold an indexed blockchain, or a minimal system with enough external storage to store an indexed blockchain (50GB~)

---

###For a minimal system follow the steps below, or use [this detailed guide.](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/wiki/Detailed-Minimal-Setup-Guide)

You must start Tails with "More options" setting in the beginning (Persistence is optional) and set an administrator password no matter which script you run.

All scripts are signed with my gpg key: [`44C5 398E A821 BB41 A0C0  7052 1B91 84DF 9E11 7718`](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/wiki/GnuPG-Key)

1. `cd /home/amnesia/Persistent (optional)`
2. `git clone https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin`
3. `cd tailsjoin`
4. `gpg --recv-keys 44C5398EA821BB41A0C070521B9184DF9E117718`
5. `gpg --verify tailsjoin.sh.asc tailsjoin.sh`
6. `./tailsjoin.sh`
    
Be aware, the script will prompt for the administrator password several times throughout.

After installation you will have to add [`torify` to every command](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/commit/0b42441277dfe77bccfefe6075cb688c0b603e4a) that does blockchain lookups because the minimal setup uses blockr.io (Coinbase):

    torify python wallet-tool.py <wallet_file>
    torify python sendpayment.py -N 4 <amount> <destination_address>
